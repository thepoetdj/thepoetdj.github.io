      <description>Finally!
It has been a while since I wrote anything here.
Migrating this site&amp;rsquo;s theme had been on my checklist for a long time.
Initially, I had used tranquilpeak theme. But soon I found out that there were many features provided by that theme which I was never going to use. And I wanted to keep the design of the site to as minimal as possible.
For the past couple of days I have been surfing through hugo themes in search for that minimal theme.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Finally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I wrote anything here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrating this site&amp;rsquo;s theme had been on my checklist for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I had used &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/&#34;&gt;tranquilpeak&lt;/a&gt; theme. But soon I found out that there were many features provided by that theme which I was never going to use. And I wanted to keep the design of the site to as minimal as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of days I have been surfing through hugo &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;themes&lt;/a&gt; in search for that minimal theme. And the result is in front of you. I have migrated to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/&#34;&gt;terminal&lt;/a&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there were very few post I had written so the migration process did not took that much time. But one thing is certain, that I am in love with this theme and will continue with it for a long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note though, I will be more active on publishing useful technical articles from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in the next post soon!&lt;/p&gt;
