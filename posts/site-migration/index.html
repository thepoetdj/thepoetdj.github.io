        <p>Finally!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It has been a while since I wrote anything here.</p>
<p>Migrating this site&rsquo;s theme had been on my checklist for a long time.</p>
<p>Initially, I had used <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/">tranquilpeak</a> theme. But soon I found out that there were many features provided by that theme which I was never going to use. And I wanted to keep the design of the site to as minimal as possible.</p>
<p>For the past couple of days I have been surfing through hugo <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">themes</a> in search for that minimal theme. And the result is in front of you. I have migrated to the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/">terminal</a> theme.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there were very few post I had written so the migration process did not took that much time. But one thing is certain, that I am in love with this theme and will continue with it for a long term.</p>
<p>One final note though, I will be more active on publishing useful technical articles from now on.</p>
<p>See you in the next post soon!</p>
